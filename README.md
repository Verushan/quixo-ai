# Move Representation
A move is represented by two pieces of information being:
- Start square
- Direction

The start square represents the piece that would be picked up. The direction represents the end of the board the piece will be placed at. There are 4 possible options for a direction namely N, S, E and W which are short for North, South, East and West.

# Move Generation Output
The printValidMoves() function in Board.h will display the board such that the valid moves will be highlighted over each square.
